**Simulation-Based Performance Study of Image Segmentation under Domain Shifts**

## Overview  
This research project investigates the performance robustness of deep learning-based image segmentation models, specifically **U-Net**, in the context of automated driving. We analyze how environmental domain shifts such as **weather variations** and **pedestrian density** affect segmentation accuracy, using the **CARLOS** simulator and **ROS** for real-time testing and data handling.

## Goals  
- Evaluate the impact of domain shifts on segmentation performance.  
- Quantify accuracy degradation in varied environmental conditions.  
- Highlight the need for **domain generalization** in real-world autonomous systems.

## Key Findings  
- Domain shifts caused up to **35% drop** in model accuracy.  
- Results underline the critical importance of model robustness and adaptability to unseen conditions.

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python, TensorFlow  
- ROS (Robot Operating System)  
- CARLOS Simulation Environment  
- U-Net CNN architecture for image segmentation  
- Real-time data handling and analysis
