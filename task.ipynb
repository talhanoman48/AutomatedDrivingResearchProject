    "\n",
    "Simulation is an important tool for accelerating development and research of automated driving functions. One of its main advantages is that simulation allows to cost-efficiently generate synthetic raw and ground-truth data, e.g., for training neural networks for perception. Transferring models trained on synthetic data to the real-world, while retaining their generalizing applicability, is an open field of research, commonly referred to as sim-to-real domain adaptation. The effect of certain types of domain shifts between training and testing data, however, can also be studied in simulation only. If a model is trained on synthetic data recorded in urban areas only, how well does it perform in rural areas? If a model is trained on synthetic data during sunny days only, how well does it perform when it is raining? Such questions can be assessed by carefully building multiple training and validation/testing datasets and evaluating trained models on those. For the immediate identification of critical scenarios with bad performance, it also makes sense to monitor key performance metrics during live simulation.\n",
